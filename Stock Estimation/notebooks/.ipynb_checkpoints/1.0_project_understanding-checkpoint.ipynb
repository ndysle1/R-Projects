    " - The resources that I intend to use for this project primarily include GitHub and RStudio. Within the R language, I plan to use the various libraries included in the Tidyverse package for data cleaning and exploration. For the model analysis and evaluation, the packages that I use will depend on which type of model is best suited to this dataset. If a logit regression is chosen to predict whether a stock should be bought or sold, then I will use the CaTools, MASS and base R packages. If a random forest approach is chosen, then I will likely use the RandomForest package. If another approach is found to be more suitable, then I will identify the best-suited package at that time."

I believe this project will be a success if I come away from this project with more confidence in my abilities, an increased technical skillset, and/or a better understanding of a data science work environment. However, specific success critieria for each project objective will be defined in the following: \n",
    "    - Project Understanding: Success will be gaining a deeper understanding of the project and its purpose and throughly answering all questions asked. \n",
    "    - Data Understanding: Success will be learning more about the variables in the dataset and understanding more about how they can be leveraged in future analysis. I should have a clear plan for the data preparation stage once this stage is complete. \n",
    "    - Data Preparation: Success will be identifying outliers, missing observations, and delivering a dataset that is throroughly prepared for analysis. If I was successful in this stage, then I will not run into any major data related issues when modeling. \n",
    "    - Modeling: Success will be creating a model that accurately predicts whether a stock should be sold or bought.\n",
    "    - Evaluation: Success will be determined using the AUC of the ROC curve."
